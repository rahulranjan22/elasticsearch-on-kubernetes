Deploy ElasticSearch on Kubernetes 
Before deploying Elasticsearch on Kubernetes, you must install the ECK operator within the Kubernetes cluster. 

There are two primary methods for installing ECK into a Kubernetes cluster.

1. Install ECK using the YAML manifests.
2. Install ECK using the Helm chart.

We will use the YAML manifest for installation.
