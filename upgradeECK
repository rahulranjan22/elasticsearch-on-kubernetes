#You can add and modify most elements of the original cluster specification provided that they translate to valid transformations of the underlying Kubernetes resources
#(for example existing volume claims cannot be downsized). The operator will attempt to apply your changes with minimal disruption to the existing cluster. 
#You should ensure that the Kubernetes cluster has sufficient resources to accommodate the changes 
#(extra storage space, sufficient memory and CPU resources to temporarily spin up new pods, and so on).

#The code provided below will enable the expansion of a single-node cluster that was previously created to a 3-node cluster.
